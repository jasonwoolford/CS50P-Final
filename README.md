# CS50P-Final
Source code for the final project in Harvard's CS50P 

1) What will your software do?  What features will it have?  How will it be executed?

    Answer: The aim of this project is to write a simple CLI-based game where the user has 60 seconds to guess the right number between 1 and 100, which will be a whole number.  The game will feature a running timer that will be shown in the console, where the countdown will be shown consistently in its own timer box.  Guesses will be taken in from the user until the timer ticks down to zero, and each guess will be given a feedback message indicating whether their guess was too high or too low.  There will be various levels of difficulty where time progresses faster as the difficulty scales up as opposed to simply reducing time overall, as this would give me a chance to play around with time stretching to create a more thrilling or perhaps anxiety-inducing experience as the player interacts with the game.

2) What new skills will you need to acquire?  What topics will you need to research?
    
    Answer: I'll have to figure out how to use the terminal in such a way that I can generate a realtime game within it, as well as the understanding of how to make such a thing happen without breaking everything along the way, but, this was the same for me during the rest of the course as well! :P

3) If working with one or two classmates, who will do what?

    Answer: I will be working alone and as such, I will be doing all of the work.

4) In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect.  And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount
    of time than you hope.  What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project?  A better outcome?  The best outcome?

    Answer: A good outcome for me would be a functional game that is readable and conveys the proper information to the user in a way that's readable if not a bit buggy visually.  A better outcomme is to have a clean interface through the entirety of the game.   The best outcome would be to include colors for feedback messages while maintaining a clean interface with the game.  Libraries may have to be used to get a clean interface going for the game, in which case, I'll have to learn how to use them.
