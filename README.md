# CS50P-Final
Source code for the final project in Harvard's CS50P 

1) What will your software do?  What features will it have?  How will it be executed?

    Answer: The aim of the project will be to create a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors that uses more than just the basic output of the command line interface to play the game.  I will be using the figlet library to create more visually interesting interface, and I will look into ways of creating a persistent border within the CLI that the game will be played inside of.  Additional features include the ability to determine a set number of games to play, the option to play until a "best of n" number of games are played, as well as a rolling score counter.

2) What new skills will you need to acquire?  What topics will you need to research?
    
    Answer: I'll have to figure out how to use the terminal in such a way that I can generate a realtime game within it, as well as the understanding of how to make such a thing happen without breaking everything along the way, but, this was the same for me during the rest of the course as well! :P

3) If working with one or two classmates, who will do what?

    Answer: I will be working alone and as such, I will be doing all of the work.

4) In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect.  And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount
    of time than you hope.  What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project?  A better outcome?  The best outcome?

    Answer: A good outcome for me would be a functional game that is readable and conveys the proper information to the user in a way that's readable if not a bit buggy visually.  A better outcomme is to have a clean interface through the entirety of the game.   The best outcome would be to include colors for feedback messages while maintaining a clean interface with the game.  Libraries may have to be used to get a clean interface going for the game, in which case, I'll have to learn how to use them.
